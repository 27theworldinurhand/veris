  "summary": " On Aug. 9, 2012, Quentin Collick was indicted for his role in the conspiracy. In November 2012, pursuant to a criminal complaint, Williams was arrested for her role in the conspiracy. The superseding indictment was unsealed today.     According to court documents, Williams worked for a debt collection company in Georgia. As part of her employment, Williams had access to names and social security numbers. She provided several names and Social Security numbers to her son-in-law, Quentin Collick.   Collick, and his co-conspirators used those names to file false tax returns from the Middle District of Alabama. Collick and his co-conspirators, in turn, cashed several fraudulent federal refund checks.   ",

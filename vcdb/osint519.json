  "summary": "Fairfax County police are investigating skimmers that were found attached to two automated teller machines at Fairfax hospitals. The devices, discovered this week, are designed to copy personal bank card information and pass codes for thieves.  Authorities said the devices may have been in place for weeks. They are urging people who may have used the machines to check their financial statements.   The devices were found Tuesday at an ATM near the lobby gift shop of the Inova Fairfax Hospital Cardiac Care Center and on Wednesday at an ATM next to the cafeteria at Inova Fair Oaks Hospital.  Police said that in one case, a hospital employee found the skimmer when she tried to insert her ATM card and the device fell off the machine. Police said a hospital security guard found the other skimmer.",

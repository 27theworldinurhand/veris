  "summary": "A federal jury in Houston today convicted Ben Harris Echols, 63, of Houston, for conspiring to commit healthcare fraud by falsifying plans of care for Medicare beneficiaries, including patients whom he did not treat.  After a four day trial, the jury convicted Echols of one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and six counts of false statements relating to health care matters.   According to evidence presented at trial, Echols was a physician practicing in the Houston area.  The evidence showed that Echols signed plans of care for Medicare beneficiaries so that fraudulent claims could be billed by Family Healthcare Group Inc. and Houston Compassionate Care.  Echols would sign plans of care for Medicare beneficiaries who were not under his care and about whose conditions he had no knowledge.  In many instances, the evidence showed, Echols would sign plans of care even though other doctors were listed as the attending physician on the documents.    Evidence presented at trial showed that Family Healthcare Group Inc. and Houston Compassionate Care fraudulently billed Medicare for home health services and were paid approximately $17.3 million by Medicare, including $5.5 million for beneficiaries for whom Echols signed a plan of care.   At trial, doctors in whose names claims were submitted to Medicare testified that they were treating the patients on plans of care signed by Echols, and that the patients did not need the care that had been billed to Medicare based on the plans. Two Medicare beneficiaries for whom Echols signed plans of care testified at trial that they had never seen Echols, that they had different primary care physicians, and they did not want or need home health care.",

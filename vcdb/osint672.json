  "summary": "One copy of XX\u2019s confidential psychological assessment report containing [patient\u2019s] name; date of birth; current placement history; developmental and psychological treatment history; limited family history; educational history; current psychological concerns; testing data, interpretation, results, and treatment recommendations was incorrectly faxed to an unintended recipient on April 16, 2013. The error resulted from an incorrect fax number entered onto the fax cover sheet (the intended number ended in 0842, while the unintended number ended in 0843). The unintended recipient notified the sender of the information that the fax was incorrectly delivered and the unintended recipient acknowledged that the fax was shredded. The fax was then correctly delivered and receipt was confirmed.",

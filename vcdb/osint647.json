The suit, which claims damages of more than $5 million, states that the personal information that was breached included Winn-Dixie employee names, addresses, birth dates, salaries and Social Security numbers.  Purchasing Power, based in Atlanta, provides an employee benefit program in which employees have the option to pay for new electronics and appliances through a payroll deduction program. Employees had the option to enroll in the program, but Burrows was not enrolled. The suit states that in the fall of 2011, a Purchasing Power employee inappropriately accessed the personal data of Winn-Dixie employees.",

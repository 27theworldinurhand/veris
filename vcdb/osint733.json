  "summary": "The watchdog said that when SPCT sold an old site it had owned it failed to conduct proper checks to ensure that patient records had either been \"removed or transferred\". The purchaser of the site subsequently discovered boxes containing approximately 1,000 documents after SPCT had vacated the premises, the ICO said.  Within the documents was \"patient identifiable data including work diaries, letters, referral forms and patient records\" which included \"confidential and highly sensitive personal data relating to over 200 data subjects including details about miscarriages, incontinence problems, child protection issues and a document from the police about the death of a child\", it said.",

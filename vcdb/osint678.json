  "summary": "Last month, a person held a Kmart employee in Little Rock, Arkansas at gun point and ordered him to open the store's safe. The perpetrator ran off with the safe's contents, including almost $6,000 and the day's backup disk.  The next problem for Kmart (or maybe the first problem)? The backup disk was not encrypted or password-protected. The Chicago Tribune reports that information on the disk included confidential information relating to prescriptions including, names, addresses and medications prescribed for almost 800 customers. According to another news source, parent company Sears says that \"certain prescriptions also contained the customer's social security number.\"",

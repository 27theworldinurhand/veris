The data included names, birth dates, diagnoses and treatment information but no financial data or Social Security numbers.  Although the laptop was password protected, it was not encrypted, the hospital said Tuesday in a statement. During the time of theft, the laptop held a file with the patient data, included as an email attachment but not saved on the desktop. Boston Children's staff could not determine if the file was accessed.",

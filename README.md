# JSON Notes
Learn more about the JSON schema definition at http://json-schema.org/.  We also are not enforcing the enumerations at the schema level, but instead have a separate file with the enumerations.  Those may update a bit more often then the schema itself.

# XML notes
The XML version has been archived until we can sync the XML with the JSON schema.  The JSON schema represents the latest version of VERIS.

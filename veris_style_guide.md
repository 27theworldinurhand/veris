# Style Guide

This is a start at a basic style guide when talking about VERIS.  As we realize things we do regularly, we will try and add them here.

## Capitalization of VERIS enumerations:
1. Figures - We commonly use sentence style (first letter in first word is capitalized and the rest is lower case.)
2. Any time we talk about an industry we capitalize.  The exception being figures.  In Figures, capitalize industries in chart names only if they are a noun “Figure 1. Breaches in Public”, not when they are used as an adjective “Figure 1. Actions in public breaches”.
3. Capitalize the VERIS enumeration if we are providing a stat. "31% was due to Cyber-Espionage."
4. If we are referring to one of the 4As (Actor, Action, Asset, Attribute and their types, but not varieties and vectors) or patterns we use common sense but lean towards things like this. If we are directly referencing the Action type we capitalize. "As you can see by a glance at Hacking and Social, they are both on the rise." But if we are just mentioning them in a sentence we do not. "Many of these attacks included both hacking and social actions."
